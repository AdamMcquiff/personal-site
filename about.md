I’m Adam McKenna, a full stack developer. I currently work at [Namics][namics] in Frankfurt, Germany as a frontend engineer. Previously, I have worked at a number of companies based in the North East of England, including [Zetec Digital][zetec] (of which I was a co-founder), [Gospelware][gospelware] and [Double Concentrate][dc]. 

My interests lay primarily in accessibility, user experience and front-end development and I occasionally write about these subjects, as well as a number of other topics pertaining to software development and the web.

Outside of the web, I enjoy listening to and writing music, over-heated politic debate, travelling and exploring nature. If you have any queries regarding my site, articles or queries about why I don’t like cheese, then feel free to [email me][mail].
