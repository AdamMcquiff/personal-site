description: Learn more about Adam McKenna - Full Stack Web Developer
---

I'm Adam McKenna, a full stack developer. I am currently working as a Frontend Developer at the [Money Advice Trust][mat], a non-profit organisation that provides free advice to people across the UK to help manage their debt. I have previously worked at [Namics][namics] in Frankfurt, Germany and several digital agencies based in North East England, including [Zetec Digital][zetec] (of which I was a co-founder), [Gospelware][gospelware] and [Double Concentrate][dc]. 

My interests lay primarily in accessibility, user experience and front-end development and I occasionally write about these subjects, as well as several other topics pertaining to software development and the web.

Outside of the web, I enjoy listening to and writing music, writing fiction and short stories, history and politics, travelling, and exploring nature. If you have any queries regarding my site, articles or queries about why I don't like cheese, then feel free to [email me][mail].
