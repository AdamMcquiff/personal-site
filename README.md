# Adam McKenna Website

[View the site here.](https://amckenna.co/)

This repository is for my personal website. I built it primarly as a blogging platform to share posts on various development topics. The site also providesa bit of context about myself to the scarce few who may be interested.

## Technology

The technology, specifications methodologies and principles that the website is built with and upon include: 

* Built with [Jekyll CMS](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* Styles developed with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) leveraging the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodologies.
* Built as a [Progressive Web App](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=progressive+web+app&oq=progressive+web+app&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i65j69i60j69i65j69i59.2029j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) with an [Application Shell Architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell) and caching handled via a JavaScript [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/).
